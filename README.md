# Programming Language Concepts - Lexical and Syntax Analyzer
Creating the lexical and syntax analyzer for a programming language. This language will be able to create variables, assign them value, calculate basic mathematic operations and relational operations for integers of different types, as well as variables that can be either.

## Token Codes Rules And Descriptions
These are the rules for recognizing all lexemes as their proper token and defines all the integer token codes for each token required in this language.

| Token | Description | Regular Expression | Token Code |
| ----- |    -----    |       -----        |    -----   |
| LETTER | Character Class: Letter | [a-zA-z] | 0 |
| DIGIT | Character Class: Number | \d | 1 |
| UNKNOWN | Unknown Characters: Symbols, Operators, keywords | N/A | 99 |
| BEGIN_KEY | Keyword to begin a program | launch | 28 |
| END_KEY | Keyword to end a program | terminate | 29 |
| LOOP_KEY | Keyword to declare a loop | reiterate | 22 |

## Production Rules For Mathematical Syntax
These are the production rules for implementing the mathematical syntax of operators and operands, loops, variable declaration, and selection statements. 

PROGRAM -> launch STATEMENTS terminate   <br />

STATEMENTS -> ASSIGN | CONDITIONAL | LOOP | MATH  <br />

CONDITIONAL -> assume ( RELATIONAL ) { STATEMENTS }  <br />

RELATIONAL -> TERM {( <= | >= | < | > | != | == ) TERM}  <br />

TERM -> identifier | int_literal | ( MATH )  <br />

ASSIGN -> declare DATATYPE  <br />

DATATYPE -> {(WORD | NUM | BIG_NUM | BOOL) = DATA}  <br />

DATA -> " identifier " | int_literal

LOOP reiterate ( RELATIONAL ) { STATEMENTS }  <br />

MATH -> EXPR {(* | / | %) EXPR}  <br />

EXPR -> FACTOR {( + | - ) FACTOR}  <br />

FACTOR -> EQUALITY {( == | != ) EQUALITY}   <br />

EQUALITY -> RELATE {( < | > ) RELATE}   <br />

RELATE -> TERM {( <= | >= ) TERM}  <br />

## Grammar
Show whether every rule set in the language conforms to the standard of an LL Grammar.

Pairwise Disjointness Test:

- FIRST( PROGRAM ) -> {launch} <br />
- FIRST( STATEMENTS ) -> {declare} {assume} {reiterate} {id} <br />
- FIRST( CONDITIONAL ) -> {assume} <br />
- FIRST( RELATIONAL ) -> {id} <br />
- FIRST( TERM ) -> {identifier} {int_literal} { ( } <br />
- FIRST( ASSIGN ) -> {declare} <br />
- FIRST( DATATYPE ) -> {WORD} {NUM} {BIG_NUM} {BOOL} <br />
- FIRST( DATA ) -> {" identifier "} {int_literal}
- FIRST( LOOP ) -> {reiterate} <br />
- FIRST( MATH ) -> {identifier} {int_literal} { ( } <br />
- FIRST( EXPR ) -> {identifier} {int_literal} { ( } <br />
- FIRST( FACTOR ) -> {identifier} {int_literal} { ( } <br />
- FIRST( EQUALITY ) -> {identifier} {int_literal} { ( } <br />
- FIRST( RELATE ) -> {identifier} {int_literal} { ( } <br />

Note: All the rules pass the pairwise disjointness test and can be parsed in a top down fashion.

Additionally, this production rules are not ambiguous grammar because there are no two ways to make the same statements.

## Assignment
- [X] Write a program that process all lexemes in a file by recognizing all tokens in a file, and produces a list of those tokens in order.

- [ ] Write a program or an extension to the above program that determines if the tokens conform to the correct syntax.

- [ ] Create 4 test files that have different names where each should have 30 or more lexemes that can be converted into tokens

- [X] Each program should have a clear beginning and end as well as a way to separate multiple statements

- [X] For integer literals, you must be able to specify whether in memory this value should be saved as 1 byte, 2 bytes, 4 bytes, or 8 bytes.

- [X] Variables should be able to be declared but on in separate lines from the assignment of value

- [X] Variable names can only be 6-8 letters, cannot contain numbers, but may contain underscores.

- [X] Language must be able to handle keywords to allow for loops, data type declarations, and selection statements.

## Testing
These test files should have 30 or more lexemes that can be converted into tokens:

**Test files with no errors at all based on the language**
* test_NoErrors_1.txt
* test_NoErrors_2.txt

<br />
<br />

**Test file with at least 5 lexical errors based on the defined rules**
Name: test_LexErrors.txt
Errors:
* declare WORD description = " Sahara';
    * The word variable name 'description' is too long of a variable name than what is required within the language and would result in an error. This is because the language enforces a variable names between the length of 6-8.

*  The next error is in the quotations enclosing the word literal "Sahara". The word ends with the wrong quotation having it continue until the end of the file without ending. The lexical analyzer wouldn't be able to determine the token for all the characters in the quotations.

* title = 'Fun Facts About the World'
    * This word litral 'Fun Facts About the Word' is encased within the wrong quotations  and would result in the lexical analyzer reading all the character up until the end of the file because the correct quotations were not given to end the variable declaration.

* myNum = 2a
    * In this integer variable declaration, the 2a would not be considered a number nor an identifier which would result in a lexical error where the data type for the variable could not be determined.

* title = "Fun Fact';
    * This is another lexical error where the string literal "Fun fact' ends with the wrong quotation which with have the lexical analyzer continuously read all the characters without an end point until it reaches the end of the file.

<br />
<br />


**Test file with at least 5 syntax errors based on the defined rules**
Name: test_SynErrors.txt
Errors: 
* declare NUM number = 3
    * All statements in this language should end with a semicolon or, if it's a code block, then an }.
        * In this case, This statement does not end in a semicolon and it will keep reading all the characters in the file until a semi colon is reached which result in grammatically incorrect statements in this language.

* assume ( number > 1) {
    * This statement results in a syntax error because any conditional code block should end with a }. In this case, this conditional code block never ends and it will keep reading until the end of file which will result in grammatically incorrect conditional statements.

* number =+ 2;
    * This statement results in a syntax error because =+ is not a recognized symbol in this language even though = and + are separately. The lexical analyzer would recognize them separately and treat them as such even though the this was never the intention.

* string = "wordssss"
    * All variable declaration statements in this language must end with semicolon. In this case, this statement does not end in a semicolon and will continue reading all the lexemes in the file until a semi colon is reached which results in grammatically incorrect declaration statements in this language.

* number -= 1;
    * This statement will result in a syntax error because, similar to previous errors, the -= is not a recognized symbol in this language even though the - and = are separately. The lexical analyzer would recognize them separately and treat them as such rather than the initial intentionl.

## Parse Tables
Create a LR (1) parse table for yourlanguage. And show the trade of 4 code samples. Each must have 6 or more tokens.
- Table must be provided and the rules must be listed
- 2 code samples must have errors
- Show where these samples fail and pass the test

## LR Parse Table For The Language
Note: Brace yourself. It is really long and you can find closeups in the folder labeled ParseTable Screenshots.
