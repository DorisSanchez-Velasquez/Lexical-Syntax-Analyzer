# Programming Language Concepts - Lexical and Syntax Analyzer
Creating the lexical and syntax analyzer for a programming language. This language will be able to create variables, assign them value, calculate basic mathematic operations and relational operations for integers of different types, as well as variables that can be either.

## Integer Token Codes
Defines the rules for recognizing all lexemes as their proper token and clearly define integer token codes for each token required for this language.

## Production Rules For Mathematical Syntax
Define production rules for implementing the mathematical syntax of operators and operands, loops, variable declaration, selection statements.

## Assignment
[] Write a program that process all lexemes in a file by recognizing all tokens in a file, and produces a list of those tokens in order.

[] Write a program or an extension to the above program that determines if the tokens conform to the correct syntax.

[] Create 4 test files that have different names where each should have 30 or more lexemes that can be converted into tokens

[] Each program should have a clear beginning and end as well as a way to separate multiple statements

[] For integer literals, you must be able to specify whether in memory this value should be saved as 1 byte, 2 bytes, 4 bytes, or 8 bytes.

[] Variables should be able to be declared but on in separate lines from the assignment of value

[] Variable names can only be 6-8 letters, cannot contain numvers, but may contain underscores.

[] Language must be able to handle keywords to allow for loops, data type declarations, and selection statements.
